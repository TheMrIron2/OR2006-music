# Iron's OutRun Music Mod

Remasters of several music tracks for OutRun 2006.

These were made originally made as cover tracks, but with growing interest in modding OutRun 2006, I have decided to make a simple mod to add my tracks to the game. I have remastered the tracks to ensure consistency with the base game music.

## Installation

Download the latest release. Extract the music tracks (FLAC files) to the Sound directory in your OutRun 2006 installation. This will *not* overwrite the original tracks as they are in a different format.

## Description

These tracks play instead of the following:

- Magical Sound Shower (Euro Mix)
- Passing Breeze (Euro Mix)
- Splash Wave (Euro Mix)
- Keep Your Heart (Remix)
- Rush a Difficulty (Remix)

You may customise your installation and replace the original or OutRun 2 versions instead. I have chosen to replace the remixed tracks where possible to keep the identity of OutRun 2, but you may choose to overwrite other versions so you can use them in arcade mode. Just rename the files to match the regular versions, eg. "01_Splash_wave.flac", "02_Magical_Sound_Shower.flac"... etc

## Known Issues

- The track previews before starting a race play the original tracks. This will be fixed later.

### Preview

You can listen to all of the songs on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3TZdxB2uT5U9jbQxVIBVzi) or a streaming service of your choice if you would like to preview them outside of the game. I have provided the Spotify versions below - the rest of the YouTube versions are coming soon.
