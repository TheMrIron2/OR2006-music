# OutRun 2006 Music Mod

Remasters of several music tracks for OutRun 2006.

These were made originally made as cover tracks, but with growing interest in modding OutRun 2006, I have decided to make a simple mod to add my tracks to the game. I have remastered the tracks to be louder as the game's original tracks are heavily compressed, and I wanted to ensure consistency with the base game music.
Note - these will overwrite the tracks in-game. If you want to keep a copy of the original tracks, make a backup of the relevant OGG files or your sound folder. 

## Known Issues

- No true loop. The tracks have been extended to cover a full OutRun run, but if playing for a longer duration (eg. 15-stage) you will notice the song fade out and restart after about 7 minutes.
- The track previews before starting a race play the original tracks. This will be fixed later.

### Preview

You can listen to all of the songs on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3TZdxB2uT5U9jbQxVIBVzi) or a streaming service of your choice if you would like to preview them outside of the game. I have provided the Spotify versions below - the rest of the YouTube versions are coming soon.
