# OutRun 2006 Music Mod

Remasters of several music tracks for OutRun 2006.

These were made originally made as cover tracks, but with growing interest in modding OutRun 2006, I have decided to make a simple mod to add my tracks to the game. I have remastered the tracks to be louder as the game's original tracks are heavily compressed, and I wanted to ensure consistency with the base game music.
Note - these will overwrite the tracks in-game. If you want to keep a copy of the original tracks, rename or make a backup of the relevant OGG files or your sound folder.

## Installation

Download the latest release. Extract the music tracks (OGG files) to the Sound directory in your OutRun 2006 installation and overwrite the existing tracks.

## Description

These tracks overwrite the following:

- Magical Sound Shower (Euro Mix)
- Passing Breeze (Euro Mix)
- Splash Wave (Euro Mix)
- Keep Your Heart (Remix)
- Rush a Difficulty (Remix)

You may customise your installation and replace the original or OutRun 2 versions instead. I have chosen to replace the remixed tracks where possible to ensure that the identity of OutRun 2 is not replaced, but you may choose to overwrite other versions so you can use them in arcade mode. Simply rename the files to match the regular versions, eg. "01_Splash_wave.ogg", "02_Magical_Sound_Shower.ogg"... etc

The tracks are primarily designed to be faithful re-imaginings of the original tracks. Rush a Difficulty is a possible exception, as while it does closely stick to the feel of the original, the arrangement is mostly inspired by the OutRun 2006 remix and is functionally more of a modern remaster.

## Known Issues

- No true loop. The tracks have been extended to cover a full OutRun run, but if playing for a longer duration (eg. 15-stage) you will notice the song fade out and restart after about 7 minutes.
- The track previews before starting a race play the original tracks. This will be fixed later.

### Preview

You can listen to all of the songs on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3TZdxB2uT5U9jbQxVIBVzi) or a streaming service of your choice if you would like to preview them outside of the game. I have provided the Spotify versions below - the rest of the YouTube versions are coming soon.
